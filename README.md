# ClaimWatchAI — Insurance Fraud Detection Analytics System 🚨🚨

## Overview
ClaimWatchAI is an explainable fraud detection system that helps insurance companies identify suspicious claims using behavioral risk indicators and interactive analytics dashboard.

Instead of manually reviewing every claim, investigators can instantly focus on high-risk claims.

---

## Problem
Insurance companies lose significant money due to fraudulent claims.  
Manual verification is slow, expensive, and often misses hidden fraud patterns.

---

## Solution
ClaimWatchAI assigns a fraud risk score to each claim based on suspicious behaviors such as:

- Late night accidents
- No police report
- No witness
- High claim amount
- Multiple previous claims
- New policy duration
- Suspicious locations

Claims are classified into:
- Low Risk
- Medium Risk
- High Risk
